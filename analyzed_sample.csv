25,"I just thought I would share my experience with you. I came off Pred in January 2020 after about a year of being on it. I was able to do so because I had followed a very low carb diet lowering my inflammatory markers. Once I was off Prednisone, I started to have a few niggles of familiar pain and stiffness. My response to that was to even lower my carb intake more. This helped a lot and now in March, I am still careful with carb intake but a little more relaxed. The PMR, I feel, is not gone but can't get a grip on me either. I have full range of motion in my limbs. only my neck gets sore if I am at the computer too long. Eventually, I believe that I will win the battle. Just my experience but it might be helpful to you as well.","I just thought I would share my experience with you. I made some changes to my diet early in 2020, which helped me feel better overall. As time went on, I noticed occasional discomfort but made further adjustments that really helped. Now, I'm still mindful of what I eat but feel much more comfortable. I've got full flexibility now, though sitting at the computer too long sometimes makes my neck ache. I believe that staying proactive will keep me on the right track. Just my experience, but it might be helpful to you as well.",0.5921102166175842,2,3,3,
